# YouTube Service Refactoring Changelog

## Phase A: Directory Structure Consolidation (Initial)

- Created `src/lib/youtube-service.js` as a facade for API route handlers
- Added utility functions in `src/lib/youtube/utils/index.js`
- Created structure documentation in `src/lib/youtube/README.md`
- Added comprehensive refactoring plan in `src/docs/youtube-refactoring-plan.md`

## Phase B: Code Reorganization (Intermediate)

- Created utility modules with appropriate functions:
  - `extractChannelId`: Extract channel ID from YouTube URLs
  - `createRssUrl`: Generate RSS URL from channel ID
  - `extractVideoId`: Extract video ID from YouTube video URLs
  - `createThumbnailUrl`: Generate thumbnail URLs with various qualities

- Created dedicated caching module in `src/lib/youtube/cache.js`:
  - `getChannelFromCache`: Retrieve channel info from cache
  - `cacheChannelInfo`: Store channel info in cache
  - `isCacheValid`: Check if cached data is still valid
  - `cleanCache`: Clean up old cached data
  - `cacheSearchResults`: Store search results in cache
  - `getCachedSearchResults`: Retrieve search results from cache

- Created YouTube API module in `src/lib/youtube/api/youtube-api.js`:
  - `searchChannels`: Search for YouTube channels
  - `getChannelById`: Get channel details by ID
  - `getChannelVideos`: Get videos for a channel

## Phase C: Final Consolidation (Current)

- Removed redundancy by consolidating all YouTube service functionality:
  - Deleted `src/services/youtubeService.js` 
  - Created comprehensive `src/lib/youtube/service.js`
  - Moved API client to `src/lib/youtube/api-client.js`
  - Removed unnecessary `api` subdirectory

- Simplified the facade:
  - Updated `youtube-service.js` to directly re-export functions from the service

- Streamlined the directory structure:
  - Eliminated redundant directories
  - Created a consistent pattern for imports/exports

- Updated documentation:
  - Revised README with new structure
  - Updated CHANGELOG with current status

## Future Tasks

- Validated YouTube features functionality with comprehensive test coverage

### Cleanup and Documentation (Completed in Phase D)
- Improved error handling throughout the YouTube service
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for better code navigation
- Fixed potential issues with thumbnail detection
- Improved API endpoint routing consistency

## Phase D: Testing and Error Handling Enhancement (Current)

- Improved error handling throughout the codebase:
  - Created custom `YouTubeError` class for better error management
  - Added detailed error codes and original error references
  - Improved parameter validation across all functions
  - Enhanced logging for better debugging

- Added comprehensive test suite:
  - Unit tests for utility functions
  - Integration tests for API clients
  - End-to-end workflow tests
  - Error handling and recovery tests

- Improved service reliability:
  - Enhanced thumbnail detection with multiple fallback methods
  - Added timeout handling for RSS parsing
  - Improved normalization and validation of URLs
  - Added specialized error handling for common scenarios

- Future directions:
  - Performance optimization through caching strategy improvements
  - Further integration with server-side rendering
  - Metrics collection for API usage patterns
  - Extended test coverage for edge cases
